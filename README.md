                    My first Data Science project could not have been different: the analysis of the Titanic dataset, one of the best known for curious beginners in the area.

                    I carried out this project as the final part of the Udacity - Data Science Fundamentals course in 2018, before pursuing formal education in the area through a master's degree.
